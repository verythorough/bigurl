# BigURL
A bookmarklet for projecting the current url in large type for people viewing your screen from a distance.

I plan to add some style, a clearly labeled button for closing, and automated URL shortening.

I was inspired to make a bookmarklet by Justine Lam, in her ForwardJS talk, "[There's a Bookmarklet for That!](https://forwardcourses.com/lectures/189)"
